# Cardiac-Arrest-Prediction

**Title** : A Machine Learning Approach Using Statistical Models for Early Detection of Cardiac Arrest in Newborn Babies in the Cardiac Intensive Care Unit

**Info**  :This project uses a Logistic Regression model to predict the likelihood of cardiac arrest based on patient health data. The goal is to demonstrate the use of a simple yet     
          effective machine learning technique for binary classification in a healthcare context.

## OverView

Cardiac arrest is a serious medical emergency, and early prediction can help save lives. This project trains a Logistic Regression model on a labeled dataset of patient features to classify whether a cardiac arrest is likely to occur.
